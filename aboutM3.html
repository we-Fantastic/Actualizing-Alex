        <p>My name is Juan Felipe Luna. I am graphic designer and self-taught front-end developer from Colombia. I currently work for as a Product Designer at Tyba, a startup that offers financial products to people in Colombia, Peru and Chile. I work in the team that created and organized our very first design system. I previously worked at Huge, where I designed websites for Google and other clients in the United States.<br>
        I am also the co-founder of Contra Studio, a design and development studio focused on creating digital products for companies, cultural institutions, and non-profits in Latin America. I oversee all the projects and tasks related to running a design studio to include: finding and planning new projects, managing a team of designers and developers, overseeing the creative direction of the projects, presenting to clients, revising the projects, designing, and much more. Our work has been recognized multiple times in Latin America.<br>
        Outside of work, I love movies and literature. I travel whenever I have the opportunity. Currently, I am based in Mexico City. One of my biggest dreams is actually to own a coffee shop. I'm also a fan of online radio stations and would love to DJ my own radio show one day. Lately, I have been learning how to mix electronic music.</p> </div>
